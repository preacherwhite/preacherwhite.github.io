Proposed **ODE-GS**, a novel framework integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting with Transformer-based latent neural ODEs to enable continuous-time extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes beyond the observed time window.
- Formulated dynamic scene extrapolation as a sequence-to-sequence problem by decoupling reconstruction from forecasting.
- Achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance on D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks.
